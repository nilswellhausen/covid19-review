## Methods

### Article Selection and Evaluation

The authors solicited relevant articles to be submitted via [GitHub](https://github.com/greenelab/covid19-review) for review.
Articles were classified as _diagnostic_, _therapeutic_, or _other_.
Following a framework often used for assessing medical literature, the review consisted of examining methods used in each relevant article, assignment (whether the study was observational or randomized), assessment, results, interpretation, and how well the study extrapolates [@doi:10.5014/ajot.60.4.367].


#### Diagnostic Papers

##### Methods

Reviewers began by describing the study question(s) being investigated by the article.
They then described the study population, the sample size, the prevalence of the disease in the study population, countries / regions considered in case of human subjects, demographics of participants, the setting, and any remaining inclusion / exclusion criteria considered.
They then described the reference test or "gold standard," if one was utilized.

##### Assignment

Reviewers described how new and reference tests were assigned, including additional relevant details about the study design.
For example, reviewers were asked whether the diagnostic test resulted in rigorous assignments of case status or was biased towards sicker or healthier individuals.

##### Assessment

Reviewers described how the test was performed.
For example, for both standard and reference tests, reviewers described technical details of assays used, when measurements were taken and by whom.
Subsequently, they described how individuals were classified as positive or negative cases and whether results were precise and reproducible with repeated tests.
Reviewers described whether there were any missing data, whether some participants underwent only one test, or whether there were individuals with inconclusive results.

##### Results

Reviewers reported the estimated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predicted value (NPV), as well as confidence bounds around these measures, if provided.

##### Interpretation

Reviewers reported how well the test ruled in or ruled out disease based on the population, if there were identified side effects, and patient adherence.

##### Extrapolation

Reviewers described how well this test will extrapolate outside the measured population.

#### Therapeutic Papers

##### Methods

Reviewers began by describing the study question(s) being investigated by the article.
They then described the study population, the sample size, the prevalence of the disease in the study population, countries / regions considered in case of human subjects, demographics of participants, the setting, and any remaining inclusion / exclusion criteria considered.

##### Assignment

Reviewers described how the treatment is assigned, whether it was an interventional or observational study, whether randomization took place, etc.

##### Assessment

###### Outcome Assessment

Reviewers described the outcome that was assessed and evaluated whether it was appropriate given the underlying study question.
They described whether there were any missing data such as whether there were individuals lost to follow up.
They then describe whether there were any potential sources of bias such as lack of blinding in a randomized controlled trial.

###### Statistical Methods Assessment

Reviewers described which statistical methods were used for inference and whether applied methods were appropriate for the study.
They then described whether adjustments were made for possible confounders.

##### Results

Reviewers described the estimated association between the treatment and outcome.
They described measures of confidence or statistical significance, if provided.

##### Interpretation

Reviewers described whether a causal claim could be made.
They described whether any side effects or interactions with other drugs were identified, as well as any subgroup findings.

##### Extrapolation

Reviewers describe how the study may extrapolate to a different species or population.
